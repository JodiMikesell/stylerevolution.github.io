    <p class="about">The purpose of the Persistence of Color Glossary and the Textiles and Materials Glossary is to provide English translations of French eighteenth-century terms related to textiles, construction of garments, materials and color. Students found that undertaking primary research, looking at eighteenth and early nineteenth century dictionaries, necessary as it becomes evident quite quickly that the linguistics of eighteenth century French is very different from twenty-first century French. The definitions congregated are offered here for the general public and scholars alike to familiarize themselves with the ways in which words were used to describe French Revolutionary fashion. The definitions and terms listed in both glossaries have been congregated from use in the Journal des Dames et Des Modes while it was in publication from 1795-1804. </p><br>

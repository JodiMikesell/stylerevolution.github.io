    <h1>Mapping the Journal des Dames et des Modes</h1>
<div class="cont-section"><br>
    <p>The Plates and Places project is a collection of videos made by combining the original figures shown in the Journal des Dames et des Modes plates and the places in which these figures were supposedly spotted. The idea behind this project was to create a visual representation of how these looks could have looked. The importance of this project is to shed light on the level of reality that these looks had. Some were really modern or at some point ridiculous and are not what we usually imagine fashion after the French Revolution looked like. So the importance is to convince the audience that these outfits were very much real and that they were not something editorial which was only worn in the magazines. </p><br>
